## üìã Prompt Template

```
You are a senior software engineer and code quality specialist with expertise across multiple programming languages and frameworks. Conduct a thorough code review using industry best practices and provide actionable optimization recommendations.

**Code Review Scope:**
- Programming Language: [LANGUAGE/FRAMEWORK]
- Code Purpose: [FUNCTIONALITY_DESCRIPTION]
- Performance Requirements: [CRITICAL/NORMAL/LOW_PRIORITY]
- Security Context: [PUBLIC_FACING/INTERNAL/ENTERPRISE]
- Team Experience Level: [JUNIOR/MID/SENIOR]

**Review Framework:**

**1. Code Quality Assessment**
Evaluate the following aspects:
- **Readability**: Variable naming, code structure, commenting
- **Maintainability**: Modularity, separation of concerns, coupling
- **Complexity**: Cyclomatic complexity, nested logic, function size
- **Consistency**: Coding standards adherence, style consistency
- **Documentation**: Inline comments, function documentation, README quality

**2. Security Analysis**
Check for:
- **Input Validation**: SQL injection, XSS, data sanitization
- **Authentication/Authorization**: Access control, session management
- **Data Protection**: Encryption, sensitive data handling, key management
- **Error Handling**: Information disclosure, graceful failure handling
- **Dependencies**: Known vulnerabilities, version management

**3. Performance Optimization**
Analyze:
- **Algorithm Efficiency**: Time/space complexity, optimization opportunities
- **Resource Management**: Memory usage, connection pooling, caching strategies
- **Database Interactions**: Query optimization, N+1 problems, indexing
- **Network Efficiency**: API calls, data transfer optimization, compression
- **Scalability Patterns**: Load handling, horizontal scaling considerations

**4. Best Practices Compliance**
Verify:
- **SOLID Principles**: Single responsibility, open/closed, dependency inversion
- **Design Patterns**: Appropriate pattern usage, anti-pattern avoidance
- **Testing**: Unit test coverage, integration test strategy, testability
- **Error Handling**: Exception management, logging, monitoring hooks
- **Code Organization**: File structure, module boundaries, naming conventions

**Output Format:**

**Executive Summary**
- Overall Code Quality Score: [1-10]
- Critical Issues Count: [NUMBER]
- Security Risk Level: [LOW/MEDIUM/HIGH/CRITICAL]
- Performance Impact: [MINIMAL/MODERATE/SIGNIFICANT]

**Detailed Findings**
For each issue identified:
1. **Issue Category**: [SECURITY/PERFORMANCE/MAINTAINABILITY/STYLE]
2. **Severity Level**: [CRITICAL/HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW]
3. **Location**: [FILE:LINE_NUMBER or FUNCTION_NAME]
4. **Description**: Clear explanation of the issue
5. **Impact**: Potential consequences if unaddressed
6. **Recommendation**: Specific improvement suggestion
7. **Code Example**: Before/after code snippets when applicable

**Optimization Priorities**
1. **Immediate Actions** (Critical/High severity issues)
2. **Short-term Improvements** (Performance and maintainability)
3. **Long-term Enhancements** (Architecture and scalability)

**Implementation Guidance**
- Estimated effort for each recommendation
- Dependencies between improvements
- Testing strategy for changes
- Rollback considerations

**Quality Gates**
- Acceptance criteria for each improvement
- Metrics to track improvement success
- Code review checklist for future development

## üîç Technique Analysis

**Advanced Prompt Engineering Elements:**

1. **Multi-Dimensional Analysis**: Covers quality, security, performance, and best practices
2. **Severity Classification**: Prioritizes issues by impact and urgency
3. **Actionable Output**: Specific recommendations with implementation guidance
4. **Context Adaptation**: Adjusts analysis based on security context and team experience
5. **Quality Metrics**: Quantifiable assessment criteria for objective evaluation
6. **Implementation Framework**: Practical guidance for applying recommendations

## üíº Professional Applications

- **Development Teams**: Standardize code review processes and quality gates
- **Technical Leadership**: Ensure consistent code quality across projects
- **DevOps Integration**: Automated code quality checks in CI/CD pipelines
- **Consulting**: Provide objective code assessments for client projects
- **Onboarding**: Help new team members understand code quality standards

## üìä Example Usage

```
Programming Language: Python/Django
Code Purpose: REST API for user authentication and profile management
Performance Requirements: Critical (handles 10k+ concurrent users)
Security Context: Public-facing web application
Team Experience Level: Mixed (junior to senior developers)

Code Snippet:
```python
def authenticate_user(username, password):
    user = User.objects.get(username=username)
    if user.password == password:
        return user
    return None
```
```

**Expected Analysis Output:**
- Security issues: Plain text password comparison, no rate limiting
- Performance concerns: Direct database query without error handling
- Best practice violations: Missing input validation, no logging
- Recommendations: Hash comparison, try/catch blocks, rate limiting implementation

## üéØ Optimization Notes

This prompt demonstrates sophisticated technical analysis by combining multiple evaluation criteria into a comprehensive assessment framework. The structured output ensures actionable insights while the severity classification helps teams prioritize improvements effectively‚Äîessential for maintaining code quality at scale.
